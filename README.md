# Understanding Key TypeScript Concepts: Interfaces vs Types & Special Types (`any`, `unknown`, `never`)

*TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that brings static typing to modern web development. As you work with TypeScript, two essential areas you'll often encounter are:*

**1. The differences between interfaces and types**, and  
**1. The use of special types like** `any`, `unknown`, and `never`.

In this blog, we’ll break down both topics in a **beginner-friendly** yet **technically accurate** way.

## What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
### 🧩 Interfaces vs Types in TypeScript

In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` are used to describe the shape of an object. Although they are similar in many ways, there are also some key differences.

---

### ✅ Interfaces:
- Like a contract that objects must follow.
- Interfaces are mainly used to define object structures. They are best for defining object shapes.
- Can be extended and merged easily.
- They support **declaration merging**, which means we can define the same interface multiple times, and TypeScript will merge them.
- They are often used in OOP patterns and class-based architecture.

**Example:**
```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Person {
  age: number;
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
```

---

### 🔹 Types:
- More flexible than interfaces – types can represent not only object shapes but also define primitive types, unions, intersections, tuples, and more.
- Types do not support declaration merging. They can't be changed after creation.
- Types are more flexible in complex scenarios, so they're useful for defining advanced types.

**Example:**
```ts
type Employee = {
  name: string;
  department: string;
};

type ID = string | number;
```

## Explain the difference between `any`, `unknown`, and `never` types in TypeScript

### 🔍 Special Types: `any`, `unknown`, and `never`

*TypeScript provides special utility types that help developers manage uncertain or unreachable values. Let’s break down the differences:*

---

### 🔹 `any`:
The `any` type disables type checking entirely. It allows any value to be assigned, making it flexible but risky.
- It turns off type checking. So, it increases the risk in TypeScript.
- Use it only when you're not sure about the value.
- Should be avoided when possible, as it can cause bugs.

**Example:**
```ts
let value: any = "hello";
value = 123;       // No error
value();           // No error, but may crash at runtime
```

---

### 🔹 `unknown`:
The `unknown` type is the safer alternative to `any`. You can assign any value to an `unknown` variable, but you must perform type checks before operations on it.
- It provides type safety. So, it is safer than `any`.
- Use it when you don't yet know the type of a value.
- Forces you to verify the type before operations.
- Useful when you’re unsure of the value’s type at compile time.

**Example:**
```ts
let input: unknown = "text";

if (typeof input === "string") {
  console.log(input.toUpperCase()); // Now safe
}
```

---

### 🔹 `never`:
The `never` type represents values that never occur. It is typically used in:
- Used in functions that throw errors or have infinite loops.
- Helpful for exhaustive checks in switch cases or error handling.

**Example:**
```ts
function throwError(): never {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong");
}
```
*This function never returns — it either throws an error or crashes.*

---

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

Understanding the differences between `interface` and `type`, and when to use `any`, `unknown`, or `never`, is crucial to writing robust TypeScript code.

- ✅ **Use `interface`** when defining simple object shapes or working with classes.  
- ✅ **Use `type`** when you need more complex compositions or primitive/union types.  
- ⚠️ **Avoid `any`** when possible.  
- 🔐 **Use `unknown`** for safely handling dynamic input.  
- 🚫 **Use `never`** for unreachable code or functions that don't return.

By mastering these concepts, you’ll not only write safer code but also leverage TypeScript’s full potential in your development workflow.
